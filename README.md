# Scroll Commands plugin for Obsidian.md

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) which adds two commands:
"Scroll to Bottom" (`obsidian-scroll-commands:scroll-bottom`), and "Scroll to Top"
(`obsidian-scroll-commands:scroll-top`), which do exactly what they say on the tin.

I know, I too was surprised Obsidian didn't have this built-in.

This plugin works in source, preview, and live preview views, as well as on mobile.
